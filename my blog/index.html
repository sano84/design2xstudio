      <img class="img-e1" src="images/beaver.jpg" alt="restoring ecology, yellowstone, wolf, beaver, elk">
      <p class="p-e1"> The disappearance of wolves by being hunted in Yellowstone park contributed to the imbalance of local ecology. Because of increased 
        population of elk, new plants fail to establish to replace old ones. This results in soil erosion. After reintroducing wolves in 1985, elk polulation 
        returned to former levels. Beavers returned too after the growth of willow at the water edge. In return, dams were constructed and minimized the risk
        of floods.

    <p class="post-para-6">A process called pyrolysis can recycle plastic waste in the abscence of oxygen to produce gasoline. There are three types of pyrolysis: slow, flash and fast. An 8.3 pounds of plastic can produce one gallon of fuel. A super glue can be made from gasoline and styrofoam. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZP5Ryd898c">(super glue). </a>The latter is so dangerous that can be easily set in fire. SO BE CAREFUL!!

    <p class="post-para-7">Would it be nice to have a flock of sheep grazing turf grass instead of lawn mowers? A specialized company in Fairfax called <a href="https://www.lambmowers.com/">Lamb Mowers</a> offeres such ecological services. Instead of charging per hour, the cost will be $275 on weekends and evenings. The benefits are tremendous. Sheep's poop are low odor 
      and biogradable fertilizer. As per the ordinance of the city, sheep should be kept on a minimum area of 2 acres. <br>

    <p class="post-para-8">Ollas are unglazed clay pots with a tappered shape buried in the ground leaving the neck opening for filling then can be capped with a clay plate. Since the wall of pots are porous, water can be pulled by adjacent roots . Ollas are eficient in irrigating plants by reducing evaporation and runoff. This method of irrigation was used over 4000 years in China.
      Many countries like India, Brazil, Iran and burkina Faso are still using this method of subsurface irrigation.

    <p class="project-para-1">An imaginery corn farm located in Georgia. This design was for my final project of Permaculture Design Course that I enrolled with Permaculture Education. Applying insecticides, pesticides and industiral fertilizers will affect soil organisms, beneficiery insects and companion plants. Although hybrid corn can produce high yield, infestion by pests can spread rapidly due to the lack of diversity. Dandelion which is considered a weed can accumulate nutrients in tissues. By mixing with soil, plants can benefit from these nutrients. 
      Moreover corn produced ethanol doesnot reduce carbon dioxide emissions as being indicated by Lark et el, 2022.

    <iframe class="iframe-2 "src="document/olive_guild.pdf" height="300" width="450" title="Iframe Example" alt="olive tree farming, moat, permaculture design principles, "></iframe>
    <p class="project-para-2">For the permaculture final project, I turned an imaginary monoculture corn field in Georgia into primary olive tree farm by applying permaculture design principles such as stacking functions / multiple functions, incorporating diverse plants, nitrogen-fixing plants, water harvesting and renewable energy systems. 
      In this system, one input can aid in producing many outputs. Applying mulch, olive trees produce olives, oil and soap. Moat and pounds
      can have multiple functions such as preventing fire spread, habitat for insects, fish & birds and a resovoir for emergency.

  <h2>-- Design --</h2>
  <div class="design-1">
    <img class = "d-1" src="design/swale1.jpg" alt = "swales, counter lines"></img>
    <p class="design-para-1"> Swales are ditches being dug along the contour line in order to
      catch, store and enable water to slowly penetrate the soil upon rainfall in slopes less than 15%. The area beneath the swale will act as sponge
      thus making suitable to grow small trees and shrubs. In a remarkable video of greening the desert, 
      Geoff Lawton explained in this video <a href="https://youtu.be/keQUqRg2qZ0?si=Q0G5Cizd8tcXIhwC">Greening the desert</a> that the purpose
      of this system was to harvest every single drop of rain. One and half km of swale ditches
      was dug on contour and was heavily mulched. A micro irrigation PE pipes were placed underneath
      the mulch. On uphill of the trench, nitrogen fixing pioneer desert trees were planted. On
      the lower side of the trench, rows of palm, fig and othe fruit trees were grown.

     <img class="d-2" src="design/schemetic_water_storage_uses (1).jpg" alt="biogass, eco-friendly water mangement"></img>
    <p class="design-para-2"> This image shows a simple, eco-friendly water and waste management layout for a small homestead or farm. At the center is a dam that
       collects water from a higher source through pipes and regulates flow with a gate valve. Excess water can spill over into another dam. Surrounding the dam 
       are trees and vegetation, likely benefiting from the water source. A barn and a house are located nearby, each with roof tanks for collecting rainwater. 
       house also connects to a greenhouse and has a biogas system for converting waste into energy. Wastewater from the house flows into a septic tank, which 
       drains into a soak pit for safe disposal. All elements are connected in a way that supports sustainable living and efficient use of water and natural
       resources.

    <img class="d-3" src="design/Lemon Guild with Cassia and Guava.jpg" alt="Lemon tree guild with lemongrass, cassia and guava"></img>
    <p class="design-para-3"> A complete farm design for self sufficiency where energy is captured from solar and water 
      harvesting from rain. Lemon trees are grown with companion trees such as lemongrass, cassia and guava where it 
      is believed that it might reduce the impact of citrus greenery also know as Huanglongbing (HLB). Lemongrass 
      attracts pollinators and acts as a ground cover. Cassia fixes nitrogen in the soil in addition to attracting 
      pollinators. Previously, it was recommended to plant guava tree with citrus. A new study by the University of
      Florida revealed that citrus interplanted with guava had higher mites population and higher incidences of diseases 
      such as canker and scab.
    <img class="d-4" src="design/Final_indian_river_project1.jpg" alt="agroforest, papaya, banana, fig trees, moat"></img>
    <p class="design-para-4">A proposal farm in Florida where fig and papaya trees are planted. Blackgum trees form a wind 
      break to the right of the farm. The benefit of blackgum tree is enormous. It can provide habits to birds, small mammals 
      and pollinators. A half moat has many functions. It can provide water source to birds, insects and fish. In addition, 
      it can act as a natural barrier to prevent the spread of forest fire. In case that the trees need water, a pump can be 
      used for irrigation. Cypress trees align the banks of this canal to provide shelter to fish. Raising both sheep
      and poultry is beneficial as the organic soil supplement.
